# Title: DataStructureAndAlgorithms
-This project is about common data structures and algorithms implementation using c#

#data structures with algorithms so far
-LinkedList
-Stack
-Queue
-BinaryTree (InOrder,PreOrder,PostOrder traversals (recursive and stack) BreadthFirstSearch)
-BinarySearchTree (Search, Insert, Delete ...)
-Heap (priority queue, using c# generic List<>)
-Graph (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

#some practices
-BigNumberAddition (LinkedList)
-MatrixOperation (LinkedList)
-RPNEvaluation (Stack)
-RPNTree (BinaryTree)
