Common Data Structure And Algorithms Implementation Using C#
============================================================
<p><b>Description: </b></p>
<p>This project is about using c# to implement common data structures and algorithms. C# is a very engineering type language, it is very efficiency at developing and cooperating.
Most common data structures and algorithms are already perfectly built in, usually people do not use c# to study structure and algorithms.</p>
<p>Using c# to implement data structure and algorithms are my very personal choice. Currently my goals include get through common data structures and algorithms, 
and be more familiar with c# language. Although c# is not a common choice, it is perfectly capable. And implementing data structure and algorithms could also help me to understand the memory model and value/reference type of C#. </p>


#data structures with algorithms so far
-LinkedList<br/>
-Stack<br/>
-Queue<br/>
-BinaryTree (InOrder,PreOrder,PostOrder traversals (recursive and stack) BreadthFirstSearch)<br/>
-BinarySearchTree (Search, Insert, Delete ...)<br/>
-Heap (priority queue, using c# generic List<>)<br/>
-Graph (Dijkstra's Algorithm)<br/>

#some practices
-BigNumberAddition (LinkedList)<br/>
-MatrixOperation (LinkedList)<br/>
-RPNEvaluation (Stack)<br/>
-RPNTree (BinaryTree)<br/>
