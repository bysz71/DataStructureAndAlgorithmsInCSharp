Common Data Structure And Algorithms Implementation Using C#
============================================================

Preface
--------
Using C# to implement data structure and algorithms seems redundant, because C# provides everything developers need to let them focus on applcation layer. I personally chose to do so based on several reasons. Although C# is not the best choice to study and explain data structure and algorithms, C# is perfectly capable of implementing them in a desired depth. To do so does not only help me to go over data structure and algorithms which in my opinion is an essential knowledge for any programmer, it also helped me to gain better understanding on the OO and memory aspects of C# language.

Introduction
------------
Data structures and algorithms are important. I've heard some programers saying that when you use some specific languages or get into some areas, they become not that important and you could totally skip them. Not saying what they said does not make 
sense, but in my opinion, even you probabely won't be using it in your work, you still need them. Data structures and algorithms really open your eyes, give you better understanding about programming languages, and affect your future thinking. 
A solid base makes you go further, and postpone the time you meet your bottleneck. I think that is why Data structures and alogrithms are usually compulsary course in university.

This project implements some common data structures and algorithms in C#. As I mentioned before, although C# isn't the usual 
choice, it is fully capable. I start this project to review data structures and algorithms, practice C#, and to try to help people who meet difficulties while learning.

I will try to give detailed explaination to every topic I list, and I will try to expand the list.
